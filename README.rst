- Implement a sklearn like time-series modeling interface
        - To fit and predict ts regression models with different regression paramters (trend, harmon, etc) and fitting (e.g. OLS, LASSO) strategies
        - Works on xarray
        - Optimized with numba
        - Can be stored as netcdf
        - Provide confidence intervals (see facebook's prophet)
        - include stability test tools (like ROC and MOSUM)
